# HL-scripts
A collection of some Half-Life scripts

...and this very file is a description of each of those.
- [ ] **Is done?** - Yup, the readme is still a WIP

### Supported engines:
- :a: - GoldSrc
- :b: - Xash3D FWGS (and/or Xash3D and WOW...?)
- :ab: - GoldSrc & Xash3D FWGS

---

## [Zoom](zoom.cfg) :ab:
Hold a button to lower your FOV and sensitivity so everything looks and feels as if you're zoomed in
(don't forget to actually bind the alias, `+zoom`).

## [Xbow](xbow.cfg) :ab:
Press a button, aim at someone and press `Mouse1` to quickly zoom in and shoot a bolt instantly.
Release the button to unzoom and switch back to your previous weapon.
The alias to bind is `xbow` (not `+xbow`, just bind the `xbow` to the key that should ready up the crossbow).

## [Command menu](commandmenu.txt) :ab:
That very menu from TFC which allows to have the needed commands at hand.
Execute configs, start recordings, rebind the keys - all within a single menu.
Just edit the file and bind `+commandmenu` to a key (I prefer `H` x3).
